<p>If an employee wishes to be reimbursed for alcohol consumed in exception to the policy above, they must have either their reporting unit's Vice President or Dean provide written approval prior to any reimbursement. Alcoholic beverages may not be reimbursed from federal grants or contracts.</p>

<h2>Alcohol consumed during an event</h2>
<p>Alcohol may be purchased for University business events and must adhere to the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The employee must indicate on the invoice or reimbursement the location of the event where the alcohol was consumed.</li>
    <li>To be reimbursed for alcohol expenses for on-campus events, the employee must obtain an alcohol permit from <a class="t4-tag-content-item " title="Home &raquo; Seattle University &raquo; CES" href="#" data-t4-type="sslink" data-t4-ss-link-id="2">Conference and Event Services</a> prior to the event. A copy of the permit must accompany the invoice or reimbursement in order for Accounts Payable to process the request. If a permit was not obtained before the event, Accounts Payable will not reimburse the expense. If the copy of the permit is not sent with the invoice or reimbursement, the request will be returned to the person responsible.</li>
    <li>Any unconsumed alcohol from an event must be stored under lock and key and used for a future event. A new alcohol permit will be needed for that future event.</li>
    <li>For off-campus events, it is the responsibility of the individual to obtain any necessary permits. The University does not need a copy of these permits.</li>
</ul>
