                <p>The P grade is assigned when a student successfully completes an undergraduate course after electing the pass/fail grading option for a general elective course. Failure to achieve at the minimum D- level results in a grade of F, which will affect the grade point average.</p>
                <p>The pass/fail grading option is not available for graduate students.</p>
                <p>Undergraduate students are allowed to choose the pass/fail grading option for courses which will be used towards <em>general electives or minors only</em> (see note below). Core courses, college requirements, and major requirements cannot be taken pass/fail.</p>
                <p>Only one course per quarter may be taken pass/fail and must be approved prior to the add/drop and change grading option date of the term of registration. This date can be found on the calendar on the Office of the Registrar web site.</p>
                <p>If a student earns a D- or above in a course where the pass/fail grading options has been chosen, the grade on the transcript will appear as a "P" (pass). A failing grade will appear as "F". A pass (P) grade does not affect a student's cumulative GPA, while a fail (F) grade will be used in the computation of the cumulative GPA.</p>

                <p><strong>CR/F:</strong> Music practice courses, some field experiences, internships, independent study in the Albers School of Business and Economics, some graduate courses, and other courses so designated by individual departments are graded only credit (CR) or fail (F). When passed with the minimum acceptable standard of D- on the undergraduate level and C on the graduate level, the course will be graded CR and credit will be granted. There will be no effect on the grade point average. Should the student fail to satisfy the instructor&rsquo;s minimal expectations, the course will be graded F and will be included in the computation of the grade point average. Schools/Colleges may have a higher grade standard for what constitutes a CR (credit). Consult the appropriate school/college handbook for this information.</p>
                <p><strong>CR/NC:</strong> The CR/NC grading mode is reserved for undergraduate credit by examination. Minimum achievement level for receiving credit is C. Neither CR nor NC affects the grade point average. See Credit by Examination section of the Undergraduate Catalog. Grade assigned when credit by examination has been attempted and student did not achieve acceptable performance level of at least C. There is no effect on the grade point average.</p>

                An Incomplete "I" grade, is a temporary grade assigned by an instructor when a student is unable to complete all course work by the end of the quarter due to illness or other serious circumstances beyond a student's control.<br/>
                An "I" grade has no effect on your grade point average, and credit for a course with an "I" grade assigned does not count towards your total number of credits earned.<br/>
                <p>To Request an "I" Grade:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Consult your instructor before the end of the quarter if you are unable to complete the course due to illness or other serious circumstances beyond your control. If an extension is approved, an "I" grade will be assigned to your transcript at grading time. Your instructor is required to submit a provisional grade along with the "I" grade. The instructor calculates the provisional grade by including all work completed to the date of final attendance plus a failing grade for all work and exams not completed. The provisional grade will be assigned if the instructor does not submit a permanent grade by the deadline to remove them"I" grade.</li>
                    <li>Be aware of the deadline to remove the "I" grade. The published date is the date that the final grade is due to the Office of the Registrar. Allow sufficient time for your instructor to review your work so that he/she can meet this deadline. <em>The deadline to replace an "I" grade with a permanent grade must now be submitted by the faculty member to the Office of the Registrar by the end of the fourth week of the next quarter.</em></li>
                </ol>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Once a degree is posted, removal of an "I" grade is not permitted.<br/>

It is your responsibility as a student to have your course work completed and submitted to your professor prior to this deadline to ensure that the faculty member meet the University deadline. If the deadline is not met, the provisional grade that was submitted at the end of the term will be the default grade. The provisional grade is based on the work you have completed.<br/>
