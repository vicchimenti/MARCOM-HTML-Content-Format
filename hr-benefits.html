<h2>Employee eligibility</h2>
<p>You are eligible to participate in Tuition Remission if you are a Regular, Benefits-Eligible employee who has worked for the University for at least three (3) consecutive full months. The University recognizes your employment relationship as the primary relationship. This means that enrollment in courses that overlap with your regular work schedule requires the prior, written approval of your supervisor. The decision to allow time for you to attend class during work hours is at the discretion of your department head and is based on factors that include the staffing needs of your work unit.</p>
<h2>Dependent Eligibility</h2>
<p>Regular, Benefits-Eligible employees who have 12 months of continuous service are entitled to Tuition Remission for undergraduate studies for their legal spouse and dependent children who have not already attained an undergraduate degree. The percentage of Tuition Remission is determined by your completed years of service as described in Programs and costs that are covered.</p>
<p>Dependent children include natural born, adopted or stepchildren. Stepchildren must be assigned joint custody to you. Children must also qualify as tax dependents according to Internal Revenue Service requirements. The University reserves the right to require proof of dependency.</p>
<h2>Programs and costs that are covered</h2>
<p>The University pays 100% of tuition for the courses you take as a University employee. If you are a full-time employee, the maximum number of credits for which you may register is 21 credits per academic year (summer qtr - spring qtr). You, your spouse, or your dependent child may also audit courses or participate as a non-matriculated student.</p>

<p>When both parents are regular University employees, years of service will be combined in determining a child&rsquo;s tuition benefit. There is no tuition charge for spouses and dependent children who are auditing courses.</p>
<p>If you completed 5 or more years of continuous full-time employment at a single, accredited institution of higher education immediately prior to joining the University, you have satisfied tuition benefits eligibility upon becoming a regular University employee. Your previous employer must be accredited in accordance with University policy. "Immediately prior" is defined as your last place of employment. If during the course of employment at the prior university you had a break in service of not longer than six months, and all other criteria are met, prior service requirements will be satisfied.</p>
<p>Advice: Be sure to let Human Resources know about any prior employment that may satisfy the Tuition Remission eligibility requirements.</p>
<p>The application fee and confirmation deposit are waived for your own tuition benefit, however application fees, but not a confirmation deposit, are charged for spouse and dependents upon enrollment. Also, you will be responsible for tuition costs for enrollment exceeding 20 credits per quarter for your spouse or child.</p>
<h2>Part-Time Benefits</h2>
<p>The tuition remission benefit paid by the University is prorated for regular, part-time employees based on their work schedule relative to a full-time employee. For example, a part-time employee who works 60% of a full-time schedule would be eligible for a maximum of 12.6 credits per academic year (60% x 21 credits = 12.6 credits) paid by the University.&nbsp; Tuition cost for credits above the prorated limit are the student&rsquo;s responsibility.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Tuition Remission benefit for spouses and dependent children is prorated if you are a regular, part-time employee. For example, if you have completed 2 years of service and work 60% of a full-time schedule, your dependent&rsquo;s tuition remission benefit equals 30% (60% work schedule x 50% Full-time tuition benefit = 30% prorated tuition benefit.)</p>
<p>The proration calculation for part-time employees is based on the weekly work hours for staff relative to 37.5 hours for a full-time person. For faculty, the contracted work units are compared to 35 full-time work units.</p>
<h2>Limitations and Exclusions</h2>
<p>The maximum number of credits is 21 per academic year for full-time regular employees. The maximum number of credits for regular, part-time employees is prorated based on your work schedule. You are responsible for course material and textbook costs as well as various fees such as private music lesson charges, lab fees, matriculation fees, program fees or late fees. Also, you are responsible for the regular application fee and registration deposit for your spouse or dependent child.</p>
<p>All University areas of study are available to regular employees except for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>School of Law;</li>
<li>Albers Executive Leadership Program, Leadership EMBA, online MBA program, online MSBA program;</li>
<li>College of Education's Doctorate in Educational Leadership ('EdD') program and also Professional and Continuing Education programs; and</li>
<li>Any course of study is excluded for spouses and children upon attainment of the first undergraduate degree.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Taxes</h2>
<p>The University&rsquo;s Tuition Remission benefit is generally tax-free to you with one exception - graduate studies. For graduate programs, the value of your Tuition Remission benefit that exceeds $5,250 is included as taxable earnings on your paycheck and will be subject to tax withholding. Consult your tax adviser for more information on the tax treatment of your education expenses, including IRS requirements.</p>
<p>Advice: You can elect to have tax withholding spread over the entire year. Contact Payroll for assistance.</p>
<h2>When benefits end</h2>
<p>The tuition benefit for your spouse or dependent child ends upon completing the credits required to graduate with a single bachelor's degree.</p>
<p>If you separate from service during an academic quarter and before final exams, the Tuition Remission benefit for you or your family member will be reduced based on the number of completed weeks of employment. The student will be billed for any remaining amounts that are due.</p>
<h2>Retirement, Death or Disability</h2>
<p>Regular employees with 10 or more consecutive years of service who retire or become disabled at age 60 or older will be eligible for Tuition Remission for dependent children. If you are a regular, part-time employee, the Tuition Remission benefit will be adjusted according to your average work schedule for the 5 most recent academic years.</p>
<h2>Who administers the benefit</h2>
<p>Human Resources processes requests for Tuition Remission and can assist you with eligibility questions or general inquiries about your tuition benefit options. The Admissions Office processes, evaluates, and makes a decision on your application based on the admission parameters determined by the University. Student Financial Services processes your financial aid information and adjusts the Tuition Remission benefit to offset federal or state awards.</p>
