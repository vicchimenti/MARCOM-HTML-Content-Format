    <h2><a id="ESAs"></a>Emotional Support Animals on Campus</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/SERVANIMALS_NTCFHEO2013-01.PDF">Under the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development&rsquo;s Rules</a>, Emotional Support Animals (&ldquo;ESAs&rdquo;) include dogs and other animals that provide <strong>passive support</strong> that mitigates, in full or part, an impact of a person's disability, allowing them to benefit from Seattle University's programs and services, including housing. An ESA can be requested and approved by&nbsp;Conference and Event Services ("CES") for guests who are not Seattle University students staying in summer overnight housing. (For Seattle University students, please see the Seattle University Housing and Residence Life <a href="https://www.seattleu.edu/housing/policies-and-procedures/emotional-support-animals/">policy</a>.</p>

    <h3>Requesting Accommodation of an Emotional Support Animal ("ESA")</h3>
    <p><strong>A guest requesting an emotional support animal should complete the following steps prior to moving into any Seattle University residence:</strong></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Make an appointment (telephone or in-person) with Conference and Event Services ("CES") to discuss the accommodation, providing documentation as indicated below. At the same time, review animal care plans.</li>
        <li>Upon approval of an "ESA for residence", the guest will be notified of the approval and next steps.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Expectations after your assignment has been made and <em>before move-in</em>:</strong></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Guest submits to CES a vet report of good health/vaccination and proof that the animal is licensed per King County and Seattle regulations.</li>
        <li>Final approval given for animal to come into residence by CES after animal care expectation meeting and vet report/licensing has been shared to CES.</li>
        <li><strong>All steps must be completed prior to animal arrival.</strong> Guests who bring an animal on campus prior to obtaining permission may be asked to remove the animal from campus.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>In order to be approved for an Emotional Support Animal (ESA), you will need documentation from an appropriate professional that:</strong></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Identifies you and states that you have a disability/health condition;</li>
        <li>Shares the relevant history of working together with the animal as it relates to the disability, and need for the animal being prescribed;</li>
        <li>Explains how the animal helps alleviate the impact of the identified disability/health condition, including the following specific information:
            <ul>
                <li>Is it the long-term relationship that has broad and diffuse impact that reduces the overall level of symptoms?</li>
                <li>Is it in moments of high stress?</li>
                <li>Are there any specific examples that would assist CES in considering the request for approval of the animal?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Identifies the basis for providing passive support (e.g. the ongoing relationship with the animal or that it serves a defined role in the person's treatment plan), and states that it is necessary for full participation in or to benefit from particular programs or environments.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Animal Care and Conduct</h3>
    <p>All animals are the responsibility of their handlers and should be under their control (in proximity to the handler and responsive to commands, in harness, leashed or in a carrier).</p>

    <ul>
        <li>An ESA or service animal must be housebroken and under owner's control (voice or tether) at all times.</li>
        <li>Puppy rearing (under six months of age) which focuses on socialization and general obedience training may not qualify as housebroken.</li>
        <li>ESAs must not be left alone for extended periods of time. It is the responsibility of the handler to arrange for care for the animal if the handler will be away from the animal overnight.</li>
        <li>All waste from ESAs or service animals must be disposed of in outside receptacles.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>An animal&rsquo;s behavior is considered the handler&rsquo;s behavior; the animal will be held to the same basic standard of conduct as its handler. If the animal is disruptive to university business or community behavioral expectations for educational, medical, and residential environments, handlers may be asked to correct the animal&rsquo;s behavior or remove it from the environment.</p>

    <h2><a id="External" title="External" name="External"></a>External Event Criteria</h2>
    <h4><a id="Event Contract"></a>Event Contract</h4>
    <p>All external clients must sign an Event Contract prior to their event. The Event Contract can not be altered and edited by the client. Please see your booking representative&nbsp;and/or your Event Coordinator for more information.&nbsp;</p>
    <h4><a id="Insurance" title="Insurance" name="Insurance"></a>Event Liability Insurance</h4>
    <p>All external clients must carry a general liability insurance policy with a minimum coverage of $1,000,000.00 and name Seattle University as an additional insured. A copy of the certificate of coverage will be required.</p>
    <p>Purchasing insurance: Seattle University has contracted with University Risk Management and Insurance Association (URMIA) to provide TULIP coverage, which is commonly known as "events coverage." This coverage enables institutions such as Seattle University to provide organizations to use facilities for specific events.&nbsp; It protects the University as well as the event organizers against claims by third parties who may get injured as a result of participating in an event.</p>
    <p>An event organizer may purchase insurance by going to the URMIA TULIP website at <a title="https://tulip.ajgrms.com/" href="https://tulip.ajgrms.com/" target="_blank">https://tulip.ajgrms.com/</a>.

    <h4><a id="Non-Profit" title="Non-Profit" name="Non-Profit"></a>Non-Profit Organizations</h4>
    <p>Seattle University fully complies with Washington State tax statutes regarding private colleges and universities. Because of this, certain programs may be prohibited from campus, or requirements may be in place that a booking organization must be a registered 501(c)(3) charitable institution. A copy of the exemption letter from the Internal Revenue Service proving 501(c)(3) status, may be required in some instances. Programs sponsored or hosted by Seattle University, such as athletic programs and summer orientations, generally allow for third party use of facilities. Please ask an Event Coordinator for clarification on any events you have that involve off campus entities.</p>

    <h2><a id="Rain" title="Rain" name="Rain"></a>Rain Site</h2>
    <p>Please note that <strong>when you are reserving outdoor space, CES requires that you have a rain site scheduled </strong>in case there is inclement weather on the day of your event.</p>
    <p>When we send you a confirmation of your space reservation, the rain site will be listed along with the space we were able to find for you. Which space you actually use will be decided on the day of the event, based on the weather of that day; however, in some cases (for example, for an early morning outdoor activity), we may make the call a day ahead.</p>
    <p>In some cases, we do not have a rain site available on the date you wish to hold your event. In those situations, you would then have two options:</p>
    <p>Choose another date; then see whether we can reserve your preferred space on that day, along with a rain site</p>
    <p>Agree to book your event, understanding that if it rains that day, and we do not have a rain site, that CES would cancel your event</p>
    <p>Please note further that because of Seattle University&rsquo;s contract with The Emerald Plate, all food service must be provided by The Emerald Plate&nbsp;in "schedulable" spaces (meaning: all spaces that CES can support). This includes outdoor locations. This is to promote the safety and well-being of all participants, by ensuring that all current required food handling guidelines are followed.</p>

        <p>If any program requires equipment or technology that needs to be rented through an outside company, CES will bill back all related costs directly to the client and provide a copy of the invoice for record keeping.</p>
        <p>Along with the contract, the client will be provided with an invoice preview, to include all estimated lodging, board, facilities fees, and audiovisual fees for all participants. Note that catering is not included in this invoice preview. At the time that the conference contract is signed, the client must submit a deposit in the amount of 25% of the grand total on the invoice preview. $500.00 of this is non-refundable. An additional deposit in the amount of 50% of the grand total on the invoice preview is due 21 days out from the start of the program.</p>
        <p>The University will send the final invoice to the client within fourty-five (45) days of completion of the program. The final invoice will reflect catering charges, actual or guaranteed attendee numbers (whichever is greater), and any additional charges including parking, permit fees, signage, rental items, technical equipment and support, and/or other miscellaneous charges. Payment is due in full within thirty (30) days of receipt of the invoice, and late payments may accrue interest at the rate of 1.5% per month. If the Client has a credit due, the University will issue a refund to the Client within (45) days of completion of the Program.</p>
        <h4><a id="Registration" title="Registration" name="Registration"></a>Registration Services</h4>
        <p>Registration services can be provided for your participants to make reservations for campus-owned housing. Registration services may include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Customizable registration website template.</li>
            <li>Accepting payments via credit card, check, money order, or cash on-site.</li>
            <li>Sending customized confirmation materials to registered participants including, as appropriate, maps, directions to specific residence, shuttle information, receipt of payment/balance due, and confirmation email with instructions for on-site registration/check-in.</li>
            <li>Providing client with standardized registration reports, including participant information, event counts, revenue summaries, and disabled-accessible information.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If Registration Services are selected by the Program, the University will do all necessary registration website setup and will collect housing and board moneys directly from individuals. The charge for this is $50.00 per person, and is typically attached to the fees that the participants pay directly to the University. A late fee of $25.00 is added to registrations received after the determined deadline.</p>

    <h4>Directional Signage</h4>
    <p>CES event equipment inventory includes A-frame (sandwich board) signs and reader board signs to help your event attendees navigate to and around your event. Ask your CES Event Coordinator to help you determine the best signage plan for your event! CES will arrange for directional signage only at the request of the client. Requests must be for signage that is directional in nature and coordination of such signage is at the discretion of CES. &nbsp;We will provide up to four A-board signs and set them up no earlier than the night prior to an event and strike the signs immediately following the event. Charges may apply for additional signage, coordination of signage and for printing of signage not within CES inventory.</p>

    <h4>Client Signage</h4>
    <p>Clients shall not post signs on walls, doors, glass, trees, vehicles or railings.</p>
    <p>Lamination of all signs is <strong>highly</strong> recommended. Seattle University's&nbsp;<a title="Reprographics department" href="http://www.seattleu.edu/repro" target="_blank">Reprographics department</a> can produce signs for your program.

    <h2><a id="Special" title="Special" name="Special"></a>Special Designation</h2>
    <p>Seattle University sometimes partners with external entities such as organizations and companies to offer events on campus that further the goals and mission of the university.</p>
    <p>Seattle University may grant one of three Special Designations to an event. These designations are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Designated Seattle University Program</li>
        <li>Hosted Program</li>
        <li>Co-Sponsored Program</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While the process for requesting Special Designation for an event has not changed - the university entity (department, student group, division, etc.) submits a form to CES to make the request &ndash; some of the requirements surrounding the designation have changed. Connie Kanter, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President for Finance and Business Affairs, brought these changes to the Deans Council and President's Cabinet and received support for them. For a document which discusses the specific changes and the old and new versions of the policy, please review <a href="https://www.seattleu.edu/media/conference-and-events-services/files/Previous-vs-New-Specially-Designated-Programs-Policy-Comparison.pdf" target="_blank">our comparison document</a>. A summary of the changes to the policy and procedure are as follows:</p>
    <p>NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL HOSTED AND CO-SPONSORED SPECIALLY DESIGNATED EVENTS:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>"Seattle University" must be prominently displayed as a Host or Co-Sponsor of the event. Marketing Communications must approve the use and placement of any university logos or branded material.</li>
        <li>For more complex or high-profile events, the hosting or co-sponsoring campus entity must have a representative at the event. (Specific definitions are within the <a href="https://www.seattleu.edu/media/conference-and-events-services/files/Facilities-Reservation-Policy-Addendum-B--Specially-Designated-Programs-2019-02.pdf" target="_blank">policy</a>.)</li>
        <li>That campus entity must identify at least one Seattle University person to act as an internal point of contact for the event. This person must assist CES in contacting the external client if there is difficulty in obtaining timely responses.</li>
        <li>Any balance due that the client has not paid by 90 days after the close of the event will be charged to the campus entity.</li>
        <li>The campus entity must provide a university GL number up front to which charges may be made if it becomes necessary.</li>
        <li>For CES staffing outside of normal operating hours, including for event monitors and/or setup and strike of event spaces, labor fees will be assessed. (This was already the case even for internal Seattle University events.)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>For those events which are granted a &ldquo;Hosted&rdquo; designation, the following additional requirements have been added:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>An administrative fee will be charged to every program according to its event classification; these are based on spaces used and the complexity of the campus support that will be required for the event. (Note: the hosting campus entity is welcome to pay the administrative fee if desired.) Please see the table below.</li>
        <li>Audiovisual equipment and support fees will no longer be waived, except for some smaller events held in classrooms (Class 4 events). Other programs (Classes 1 &ndash; 3) will pay discounted, co-sponsored rates for audiovisual equipment and support.</li>
        <li>Due to the demand for space for paying summer conference clients, Summer Conferences will be no longer be allowed to have the &ldquo;Hosted&rdquo; special designation. The Co-Sponsored option will still be available.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img style="display: block;" class="t4-tag-content-item mceNonEditable" src="https://cms.seattleu.edu/terminalfour/SiteManager?ctfn=download&amp;fnno=60&amp;ceid=ef9de84284100ec4ddfd2361457828c354274245" alt="Special Designation Table New" data-t4-instance-id="162" data-t4-media-id="425177" data-t4-markup-for="425177" data-t4-media-attributes="{&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;width&quot;:&quot;711&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;228&quot;,&quot;display&quot;:&quot;block&quot;,&quot;margin-left&quot;:&quot;auto&quot;,&quot;margin-right&quot;:&quot;auto&quot;}}" data-t4-media-formatter="image/*" data-t4-media-language="en" data-t4-type="media" /></p>
    <p>These changes will apply to programs that will take place after July 1, 2019 if they have not yet submitted and received authorization on a Special Designation form. Programs whose requests have already been processed will be given the benefits that were in place when their forms were signed.</p>
    <p>As has always been the case: in order to receive any of these designations, requestors must first review the criteria for their desired designation; once they have determined that the designation they wish to request is in line with the intention for it, requestors must fully complete the <a href="https://www.seattleu.edu/media/conference-and-events-services/files/Program-Special-Designation-Approval-Form.pdf" target="_blank">Special Designation Form</a> and submit it for approval.&nbsp; Designations are not final until approved or denied and signed by the highest level authorizer listed on the request form.</p>
    <p>Events wishing to receive Special Designation status should submit their requests as far in advance as possible.</p>

    </ul>

    <h4>Alcohol at Student Events</h4>
    <p>Seattle University allows wine and beer to be served on campus with an approved&nbsp;<a title="Alcohol Service Request Form" href="https://www.seattleu.edu/media/conference-and-events-services/files/Fillable-Alcohol-Service-Request-Form-Updated-July-2018.pdf">Alcohol Service Request Form</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;an alcohol service plan that is reviewed and approved by the Center for Student Involvement.&nbsp;<strong>"BYOB" events, beer kegs and hard liquor are not permitted on campus</strong>.</p>

        <li>Permission for alcohol to be served at student events must first be approved by the Center for Student Involvement and an alcohol service plan will have to be developed with them. Once approved by the Center for Student Involvement, the necessary forms must be submitted to CES for approval as well</li>

        <li>SU Student Leaders will be held accountable to the Principles for SU Student Leaders, in addition to the Code of Conduct</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Food &amp; Catering at Student Events</h4>
    <p>If your club, organization, or class is holding an event in which food will be served, you will want to review the&nbsp; which includes a flow chart of procedures.&nbsp; It also provides information on policies and procedures for legacy events, events with 76 or more guests, events with 75 or fewer guests, bake sales, and what are determined to be "non-potentially hazardous foods.</p>

    <h4>Safety Guidelines for Food Service at Student Events</h4>
    <p>Be sure to familiarize yourself with the requirements of the <a title="Seattle-King County Health Department" href="http://www.kingcounty.gov/healthservices/health/ehs/foodsafety.aspx" target="_blank">Seattle-King County Health Department</a> (KCHD)</p>
    <p>CES will first need to determine if your event is "open" or "closed" and if a KCHD permit will be required. If your group is preparing food items and your event is open to the public, a temporary food service establishment permit must be obtained from the King County Health Department for a fee. To avoid a late fee penalty, application paperwork must be submitted at least three weeks in advance of the event. Two certified Food Handlers that are students and part of the organization must be identified as part of the application process and one of these must be present at all times during the preparation, cooking, and distribution phases of the food production. Although closed events do not require a temporary food service establishment permit, a meeting with CES is still required to discuss the preparation, cooking, distribution phases and food safety guidelines for your event.</p>
    <p>King County Health Department requires food to be prepared in a licensed kitchen. On campus there are three kitchens available and arrangements for use must be made at least two weeks in advance.</p>
    <p>Use of Campion kitchen may be arranged through CES at (206) 296-5620. Campion kitchen is currently equipped with a walk-in refrigerator, rotary oven, and a two-compartment steamer.</p>
    <p>The International Student and Scholar Center (ISSC) also has a small kitchen and food service equipment which is available upon request by calling (206) 296-6260.</p>
    <p>The Cherry Street Market kitchen is only available in certain specific circumstances under special arrangement with RedHawk Dining. Rental fees may apply.</p>
    <p>For the protection of the public's safety and health, proper food handling, temperature control, transportation of food, and sanitation procedures must be strictly followed.</p>

    <p>Student groups are responsible for providing the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Antibacterial Hand Soap</li>
        <li>Bleach Cleaning Solution Pail/Cloths</li>
        <li>Gloves</li>
        <li>Hot Water</li>
        <li>Meat Thermometer</li>
        <li>Paper Towels</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A King County Health Inspector will conduct an on-site inspection at the beginning of your event to ensure that proper food handling procedures are understood and are being followed.</p>

    <h4>Bake Sales for Student Groups</h4>
    <p>Some clubs, organizations, and classes wish to hold&nbsp;<strong>Bake Sales</strong>to raise funds. If you wish to make arrangements for a Bake Sale, the first step is to fill out a <strong>Student Event Request Form</strong> to reserve a table at which to hold your Bake Sale. The deadline for this is <strong>twenty (20) business days</strong> prior to the event, so please give yourself enough time.</p>

    <p>Next, you will need to submit a <a class="t4-tag-content-item mceNonEditable" href="https://cms.seattleu.edu/terminalfour/SiteManager?ctfn=download&amp;fnno=60&amp;ceid=d01efafacc84fedeb791cd732fbbb250027443de" data-t4-instance-id="164" data-t4-media-id="424004" data-t4-markup-for="424004" data-t4-media-attributes="{&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Bake Sale Form&quot;}}" data-t4-media-formatter="application/*" data-t4-media-language="en" data-t4-type="media">Bake Sale Form</a>. Your club advisor or supervising faculty member will need to authorize the form.<br /><br />Finally, your class, organization or club will need to familiarize itself with King County Health Department regulations. This contains a compilation of those foods that may be sold without the purchase of a health department permit. If you do plan to serve foods not on the "exempt" list, you need to arrange the event at least <strong>45 days </strong>prior to the event. The permit costs around $300 and requires King County Health Department approval.</p>
