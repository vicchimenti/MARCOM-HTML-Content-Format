<p>Carpool permits are for two or more Seattle University Community members commuting to and from Seattle University. To be recognized as a carpool, the members MUST arrive on campus together inside one vehicle. Student carpools as well as employee carpools will receive <em>one</em> permit for each carpool group. When carpooling, the rear view mirror hangtag must be displayed on the vehicle that you are arriving in. The permit is valid during the hours of 6:00 a.m. to midnight.</p>
<p>For the times that carpool members are unable to drive together, Seattle University offers a courtesy Single Occupancy Vehicle Pass (SOV Pass) to all drivers in the carpool that have registered their vehicle with Seattle University Public Safety. SOV Passes are issued with an allotment of blank date boxes that are to be used during the time the permit is valid. These dates represent the total amount of visits to campus a carpool member can make alone (one day per week during the semester/quarter for the length of the carpool permit). When arriving to campus alone it is the responsibility of the driver to write-in the date of your arrival in an blank date box. The current date MUST be written in INK and may NOT be modified, corrected, or otherwise altered in any way. Each date box may only be use one time. The absence of a Booth Attendant does not relieve the driver of their responsibility to have a valid pass displayed. Use of the SOV permit is not valid for the Pigott Visitor Lot (12th and Marion) before 3pm Monday-Friday. Failure to follow the University parking rules and regulations may result in revocation of parking privileges.</p>
