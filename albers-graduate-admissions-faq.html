<h2>Application & Admission</h2>
<p><strong>What programs do you offer?</strong><br />We offer degree programs, joint degrees, and certificates. Please <a class="t4-tag-content-item " title="Home &raquo; Seattle University &raquo; Albers School of Business and Economics &raquo; Graduate &raquo; Degrees" href="#" data-t4-type="sslink" data-t4-ss-link-id="401">visit our Degrees page</a> for more details on each program offered.</p>
<p><strong>Which program is right for me?</strong><br />We can help you assess which program suits your interests and needs best. Please review the programs we offer and their requirements. We encourage you to contact one of our <a class="t4-tag-content-item " title="Home &raquo; Seattle University &raquo; Albers School of Business and Economics &raquo; Graduate &raquo; Advising" href="#" data-t4-type="sslink" data-t4-ss-link-id="404">advisors</a> if you&rsquo;d like to make an appointment.</p>
<p><strong>How does SU&rsquo;s PMBA Program compare to UW&rsquo;s PMBA Program?</strong><br />Unfortunately, we can't address the details of the program that the UW offers. Our best advice is to look at the ratio of core to elective classes, as well as how many elective and certificate options you would have at either program.</p>
<p><strong>What is the average class size?</strong><br />Average class size is 20 to 25</p>
<p><strong>What's the difference between the PMBA, BMBA, and EMBA Programs?</strong><br /> We have a great webpage for that, please visit <a class="t4-tag-content-item " title="Home &raquo; Seattle University &raquo; Albers School of Business and Economics &raquo; Graduate  &raquo; Degrees &raquo; Which MBA Is Right for You?" href="#" data-t4-type="sslink" data-t4-ss-link-id="393">Which MBA Is Right For You</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Do you offer a graduate program in Information Technology or Information Systems?</strong><br /> Please see the Computer Science program offered through our College of Science &amp; Engineering. If you are interested in data analytics, please see the Master of Science in Business Analytics offered here at the business school.</p>
<p><strong>Can I make an appointment with an admissions advisor?</strong><br /> We would love to get all of your questions answered. If you would like to schedule a time to talk with one of our graduate advisors feel free to give the front desk here at the business school a call to schedule a one on one meeting. The number is 206-296-5700.</p>
<p><strong>What is the difference in a Certificate and a Master's degree? Which is best for me?</strong><br /> Consider the certificate similar to a "minor" and the full program as the &ldquo;degree.&rdquo; If you need to review a topic, a certificate is a great option. Additionally, it is a good option for someone who is established in a career, but would like to transition into a new area or enhance a skillset.&nbsp; They are designed to allow working professionals to develop expertise and acquire a credential beyond their undergraduate degree without having to complete a full graduate degree program.</p>
<p><strong>Can I start with a Certificate and transfer those credits into a Master's degree later?</strong><br />Absolutely. You may begin a certificate program and subsequently apply for graduate program. You must begin this process before the final quarter of your certificate program. Please also note that once you have completed a certificate program those credits are &ldquo;locked&rdquo; and not available for application towards a Master's degree.</p>
<p><strong>What does AACSB accredited mean? Why is it important?</strong><br /> AACSB stands for <a title="The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business" href="http://aacsb.edu/" target="_blank">The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business</a>. AACSB Accreditation represents the highest standard of achievement for business schools worldwide. Less than 5% of the world's 13,000 business programs have earned AACSB Accreditation. AACSB-accredited schools produce graduates who are highly skilled and more desirable to employers than other non-accredited schools.</p>
<p><strong>May I submit GRE score instead of GMAT?</strong><br />Yes, we accept both GRE score and GMAT score.</p>
<p><strong>May I take classes before I have taken the GMAT?</strong><br />No, the GMAT must be completed before students may begin the graduate program.</p>
<p><strong>Is the program a cohort program or a rolling admission?</strong><br /> Our programs are on a rolling admission schedule. We accept applications and students every quarter of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any opportunities to learn more about the graduate programs at Seattle University?</strong> <br /> Yes, there are&nbsp;<a class="t4-tag-content-item " title="Home &raquo; Seattle University &raquo; Albers School of Business and Economics &raquo; News and Events &raquo; Information Sessions" href="#" data-t4-type="sslink" data-t4-ss-link-id="392">information sessions</a>&nbsp;online and in person at the Seattle campus. You may also schedule a meeting with a graduate advisor by calling the Albers School of Business and Economics front desk at (206) 296-5700.</p>

<p><strong>Does Albers offer a GMAT prep class?&nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes. You may access&nbsp;<a class="t4-tag-content-item " title="Home &raquo; Seattle University &raquo; Albers School of Business and Economics &raquo; Graduate &raquo; Admissions &raquo; GMAT Prep Class" href="#" data-t4-type="sslink" data-t4-ss-link-id="399">GMAT</a> information on the website.</p>
<p><strong>Can I still be accepted if my GMAT/GRE score comes in after the deadline but I submitted the rest of my application?<br /></strong>We recommend taking the test no later than two weeks prior to the deadline. At the testing center you can request an unofficial, printed score. Bring that score to the admissions office and this will act as a &ldquo;placeholder&rdquo; while your application is being reviewed. The official score that is mailed to the school by GMAC will then confirm your unofficial score.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you require letters of recommendation or a personal statement?<br /></strong>Personal statements are optional for all graduate programs except for the MSBA and Bridge MBA programs. Letters of recommendation are not required for admission to any of our graduate programs. We encourage you to include these documents if there is information you feel is important for the committee to take into consideration in their decision.</p>
<p><strong>Do you accept students only in the fall or throughout the year?<br /></strong>We have a rolling admissions policy for all programs, excluding the Bridge and MSBA programs which only begin in the fall. For all other programs, students are accepted year round, giving you the ability to begin any program in the term that best works with your schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need an undergraduate degree to be accepted?<br /></strong>Yes</p>
<p><strong>What's the minimum GPA required to be accepted?<br /></strong>Please visit the following links to our class profiles regarding the average GPA for all programs. While this is not a minimum, it is an indicator of the scores that we are receiving:</p>

Business Calculus, if not waived upon admission, must be completed within the first year of the program. Professional Writing can be satisfied by earning in the 25 percentile or higher on the verbal and writing section of the GMAT. Students who do not meet this minimum will be required to complete the <a class="t4-tag-content-item " title="Home &raquo; Seattle University &raquo; Albers School of Business and Economics &raquo; Graduate &raquo; Courses &amp; Syllabi &raquo; Professional Writing" href="#" data-t4-type="sslink" data-t4-ss-link-id="400">Professional Writing</a> class in their first quarter of the program.</p>

<p><strong>What courses can I waive and how?<br /></strong>A meeting with your academic advisor will determine the number of classes able to be waived.&nbsp; Waivers are based on previously completed courses and the grade received.</p>
<p><strong>How many courses per quarter do I need to be considered full-time?<br /></strong>Any course load above 6 credits (or 2 classes) per quarter is considered full time enrollment.</p>
<p><strong>Can I be a full-time student even though the program is called &ldquo;Part-time MBA&rdquo;?<br /></strong>If your schedule permits, you may enroll in more than one class. The majority of our students are employed and working full time while attending class in the evenings.</p>
<p><strong>Are there graduate classes during the day?<br /></strong>No graduate classes are held during the day in the following Albers Graduate programs:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Professional MBA</li>
    <li>Master of Professional Accounting</li>
    <li>Master of Science in Finance</li>
    <li>Master of Science, Business Analytics</li>
</ul>

<p>In contrast, all classes for the Bridge MBA program are held during the day.</p>
<p><strong>When are the evening classes?<br /></strong>6 p.m. to 8:40 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I am working full time, how many classes do you recommend I take?<br /></strong>Most students working full-time take 2 classes per quarter; 6 credits.</p>
<p><strong>How much study time is required per class on average?<br /></strong>The average student spends 1 to 2 times the amount of time preparing for class or studying as they spend in class. For example, one class per week for 2.5 hours = 2.5-5 hours of preparation each week.</p>
<p><strong>How many classes will I have per week?&nbsp;<br /></strong>Each class meets once a week in the evening. If you take 2 classes, you will have 2 classes every week, one per evening.</p>
<p><strong>What certificates are available?</strong>&nbsp;<br />We offer Graduate Certificates that can be taken in conjunction with the graduate degree programs. For more information on those, visit our&nbsp;<a class="t4-tag-content-item " title="Home &raquo; Seattle University &raquo; Albers School of Business and Economics &raquo; Graduate &raquo; Certificates" href="#" data-t4-type="sslink" data-t4-ss-link-id="403">Certificates</a> page.</p>
