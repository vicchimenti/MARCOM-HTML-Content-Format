This is to be awarded to those with a particular emphasis on spiritual and pastoral ministry.

    <h2>Resource: Scholarships Binder</h2>
    <p>As a service to students, we've compiled other scholarship opportunities in a binder that students can check out and look through. This compilation is by no means comprehensive but is a resource. Students are encouraged to inquire with their employer and/or denominational group(s) for professional development moneys, tuition reimbursement or scholarship opportunities.</p>
    <h3>To check out the binder</h3>
    <p>Contact Thanh-Thuong (Thuong) Thi ChuChe, MAPC | Budget & Scholarship Manager, Seattle University School of Theology and Ministry | 206.296.5338 | <a href="mailto:chuchet@seattleu.edu">chuchet@seattleu.edu</a></p>
    <h2>Scholarship Implications of Adding / Dropping Credits</h2>
    <p>Should your credit projections change after the pre-registration deadline of April 1st, changes must be submitted to Seattle University School of Theology and Ministry's Financial Aid Manager in writing 14 days before each quarter's classes begin.</p>
    <p>Tuition aid may not be available for credits added after the April 1st financial aid application deadline and aid is not transferable to subsequent quarters.</p>
    <p>Seattle University School of Theology and Ministry's financial aid budget is finite. The amount and percentage of aid each student receives is determined every spring for the subsequent academic year. It is directly proportionate to each student's credit load, and additions and decreases in credits affect the amount of aid available to other students of the School. When courses are dropped after the published add/drop dates, students receive only a portion of their tuition back. Likewise, the School is reimbursed only a portion of the aid extended to students who drop after the deadline. Ultimately, this too affects the amount available for others in need. It is important that each student plan his or her course load wisely,&nbsp;in conjunction with their academic advisor and completes a course projection annually, notifies the Financial Aid Coordinator in writing of any changes in the credit load, and observes all deadlines.</p>
    <h2>Credit Changes:</h2>
    <p>The amount of your tuition aid grant is based proportionately on the number of credits you projected you would be registering for on your Declaration of Credits form. If you increase or decrease your course load, your credits will not match what you have been given a scholarship for and your aid will not release. If you do not notify the School of Theology and Ministry Financial Aid Manager about your change of credits, you could forfeit some or all of your financial aid grant. There is no guarantee that there will be additional scholarship funding available from the pool for an increase in the number of credits that you might be taking so please plan accordingly. Conversely, if you are reducing credits, the funds need to be reduced from your award and returned back to the pool so it is available for other students who are increasing their credits and have a financial need. Please make sure that you report any change in the number of credits you will be taking to the School Financial Aid Manager, Beth Smith, prior to the beginning of each quarter. Changes must be made in writing, by email, or by completing the necessary change of credits form in the School of Theology and Ministry office.</p>

    <h2>Scholarship Appeal Process:</h2>

The appeal should explain the reason(s) for why the increase is needed and what changes you will be making to become financially stable.&nbsp; Please send the appeal to Beth Smith at the contact information listed above.&nbsp; You will be notified of the Scholarship Committee's decision within approximately two weeks of your request.</p>
