<h2>II. Core Courses</h2>
<h4>24 credits. 19 of the required core credits are offered in 2 tracks.</h4>
<p><strong>The Seattle University PMBA Core is focused on developing managers who navigate complexity to solve business problems, recognize (or create) opportunities, and become more adept in thinking holistically (people, processes, and technologies) about business challenges.</strong></p>
<h4>Seattle University Professional MBA Core Class Methodology:</h4>
<p>Upon the advice of our MBA Advisory Board, when we updated our PMBA program we decided to integrate our core curriculum. We did this because our industry advisors informed us that most MBA graduates do not realize how to integrate various business disciplines to solve complex business problems. Therefore, we designed our PMBA core curriculum to be both solution-based and integrated in nature. Most MBA core classes are vertically integrated (one accounting, one marketing, one HR, etc.); all of our core classes are integrated so each class combines three different business disciplines to solve the particular problem we have identified for that class. This allows students to understand how an integration of different business disciplines are needed to solve complex business problems.</p>
<h4>Core Class Logistics:</h4>
<p>In addition, we have split the core into two different tracks: the Behavioral Core (Management, Ethics, and Leadership) and the Analytical Core (Accounting, Finance, Statistics, etc.). Students can either take the two core tracks simultaneously or take the Behavioral Core first followed by the Analytical Core. The Core starts twice yearly, in fall quarter and again in spring quarter. Core classes are not offered during the summer. Prerequisite classes (Financial and Managerial Accounting as well as Statistics) are required before a student can begin the Analytical Core. These prerequisite classes are offered the quarter before the core classes begin.</p>
<p>If taking the core simultaneously, you will be required to take the Behavioral Core with the same students for all three classes. For example, you would take Behavioral Core 1 on Wednesday nights fall quarter, Behavioral Core 2 on Wednesday nights winter quarter, and Behavioral Core 3 on Wednesday nights spring quarter. That way you track with the same students all three quarters. This helps develop a strong network among your fellow Behavioral Core classmates.</p>
<h4>Your Core Class Experience:</h4>
<p>Since each Core class will have three different professors, the classroom experience will be different than anything you have experienced in the past. Class moves quickly and transitions to different topics often. It frequently takes a whole quarter or even the whole core to see how disciplines are interrelated. This has been specifically designed to mimic the chaotic nature of business and helps train you for thinking systematically in non-linear situations.</p>
