<h2>Theme Communities (2019-2020)</h2>
<p>At Seattle University, we understand that our small campus may feel large at times. In response, we have designed smaller theme communities within our residence halls. These communities allow students an opportunity to make immediate connections with their neighbors who are likely to have common interests. The residence hall staff work hard to provide fun and educational programs and activities based around the theme to assist students with connecting to the greater University community.</p>
<p>Theme Communities will be offered in all residential buildings. Students are not required to be in specific majors to participate in any community and have the ability to determine their own level of involvement. In addition, students are welcome to participate in events hosted by communities other than the one to which they are assigned.</p>
<p>When students complete their housing application, they will be asked to preference at least five communities. Brief descriptions of each theme community, and the buildings in which they are located, are listed below. As students consider their preferences, they should also think about their ideal building placement. It is important to note that specific roommate requests will be prioritized over theme community preferences (so if roommates have different preferences, we will first match roommate pairs and then consider theme/building preferences).</p>
