<h1 style="text-align: center;">Major GPA Calculation</h1>
<p>The College of Arts and Sciences developed a useful automated tool for GPA calculation:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.seattleu.edu/premajor/gpa-calculator/">https://www.seattleu.edu/premajor/gpa-calculator/</a></p>
<p><strong>Procedure to Calculate Your Cumulative GPA:</strong> Multiply the number of credits for each course by the numeric grade achieved for that course (see below) to determine grade points. Divide the sum of the grade points by the total number of credits attempted.</p>
<p><strong>Note to current students:</strong>&nbsp;Your cumulative, major and/or minor GPAs are displayed on your&nbsp;<a href="https://suonline.seattleu.edu/">SU Online</a>&nbsp;Program Evaluation.&nbsp;<br /><strong>Note to former students:</strong>&nbsp;Your cumulative GPA is displayed on your official or unofficial transcript,&nbsp;<strong>but your program GPA is not on an official or unofficial transcript.</strong>&nbsp;Use the procedure below to calculate your major, minor, or last two year GPAs.</p>
<p>If a course is a&nbsp;<strong>repeat</strong>&nbsp;(as indicated by an R next to the credits, for the first attempt on the official transcript), the credits and quality points from the first attempt are excluded,&nbsp;<strong>only the second attempt is used in calculation</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To calculate your major, minor, or last two years GPA:</strong> Follow the calculation process outlined below on just those courses that apply to your major, minor, or last two years of course work. Your courses and grades are listed on your unofficial or official transcript. You can find which courses apply to your major or minor by referring to the&nbsp;<a href="http://catalog.seattleu.edu/">Catalog</a>&nbsp;from the year you were accepted into your major. If you are a current student, you can verify the Catalog year that applies to you and the courses required for your major or minor by accessing your Program Evaluation on&nbsp;<a href="https://suonline.seattleu.edu/">SU Online</a>.</p>
<p><span>The grades of CR, HW, I, IP, LW, M, N, NC, P, Q, R, W, Y, YW, or Z have no quality point value.</span></p>

<p><strong>Letter Grade and Numeric Equivalent</strong></p>

<p><strong>Credit x Numeric = Grade Points</strong></p>

<p>English 1100, 5 credits</p>

<p>5 x 4 = 20 grade points</p>
</td>

<p>Biology 2000, 5 credits</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>B (3.0)</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>5 x 3 = 15 grade points</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p>Art 1210, 3 credits</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>C (2.0)</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>3 x 2 = 6 grade points</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Total grade points = 41 (sum of 20 15 6)</p>
<p>Total credits attempted = 13 (sum of 5 5 3)</p>
<p>Total grade points divided by credits attempted equals GPA</p>
<p>41 divided by 13 equals a GPA of 3.15&nbsp;(Note that SU does not round up)</p>
