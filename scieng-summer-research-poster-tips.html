<ul>
<li>Greet the observer and ask if they would like a brief introduction to the topic.</li>
<li>Give a 2 minute speech about your topic and after ask if the observer has any questions.</li>
<li>Allow for a brief discussion if questions are asked. This is an opportunity to hear a new perspective from the observer or a shared experience or a relevant reference from the literature.</li>
<li>In some cases, business cards are exchanged and either the presenter or observer writes on the back of the card something they plan to convey to the other via email.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Enjoy the experience and have fun!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Help - Rubric Example</h2>
<p>Below is a rubric that is used to grade posters in the Chemistry Department.&nbsp; Please use it as a tool to look over your poster elements and to do a practice presentation with your mentor and/or a group of student colleagues, or a science student friend. By doing practice presentations, it will provide a great opportunity to receive feedback before you present at the poster session.</p>
