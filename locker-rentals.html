<h2>Renewals&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></h2>
<div>
<div>
<p>We will do our best to send an email reminder to renew your locker up to two weeks in advance of your expiration however please note it is your responsibility to renew or clear out your locker prior to or on the expiration date. Because of the high demand for lockers, expiring lockers must be either renewed or cleaned out by the expiration date so that vacancies can be rented out to those on our waitlist.</p>
<p>Failure to renew or clear out an expired locker will result in the lock being cut, items being stored in lost and found, and after 15 days items will be donated.&nbsp;</p>
