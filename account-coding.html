<h2><strong>Examples of Cash Receipts Coding</strong></h2>
<p>Generally, all funds received by the university are credited to a revenue account. Revenues can be in the form of gifts, grants, tuition, fees, rentals, bookstore sales, etc. All revenues must be assigned a seventeen digit account code for proper accounting. Funds received as gifts must be forwarded to the University Advancement Office for processing. Funds received from grant agencies must be forwarded to Controller's Office for processing. Funds other than gifts and grants are processed by the department or reporting unit. The department, reporting unit or activity manager must assign a seventeen-digit code to these receipts and forward them to the Controller's Office for further processing.</p>
<h3>Cash Receipt Example 1</h3>
<p>The School of Business received a check for $2,000.00 from a donor as a gift for the Accounting Department. Since this is a gift, the activity manager must forward the check to the University Advancement Office for account coding and depositing.</p>
<h3>Cash Receipt Example 2</h3>
<p>The Department of Physics received a check for $3,500.00 as a grant from a government agency. Since this is a grant, the activity manager must forward the check to Controller's Office for account coding and depositing.</p>

<h3>Cash Receipt Example 3</h3>
<p>The Lemieux Library and Law Library may occasionally receives monies (e.g., library fees) for certain types of services provided to the users. The library will provide the seventeen-digit code on the cash receipt form and bring them to the Controller's Office for deposit. In this instance, the coding should be 11-0-0-30XXXX-4302030.&nbsp; Note that because this is a revenue, the Function should always be &ldquo;0&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Cash Receipt Example 4</h3>
