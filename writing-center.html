<p>We are dedicated to fully engaging SU students in becoming the most effective writers they can be.</p>
<ul>
<li>During one-on-one, hour-long sessions,&nbsp;the consultant&nbsp;helps the&nbsp;student to complete an individual assignment in the context of becoming a better writer. When you arrive, you and your consultant will discuss the requirements of the assignment, set and work through an agenda, and plan the next steps to&nbsp;aid you in your&nbsp;work&nbsp;outside of&nbsp;the Writing Center. <br /> &nbsp;</li>
<li>Come in early in your writing process and return more than once for each paper for best results. Be sure to bring a copy of the assignment, an idea of what you would like to work on, and any legible notes or drafts.<br /> &nbsp;</li>
<li>To best use of our services,&nbsp;consider developing an on-going working relationship with a particular consultant. That consultant can become more familiar with your style and concerns so as to best help you with each new assignment.<br /> &nbsp;</li>
<li>Call, stop by, or follow the link above to make an appointment at the Writing Center. Please try to make an appointment well in advance, especially during midterms and finals.</li>
</ul>
