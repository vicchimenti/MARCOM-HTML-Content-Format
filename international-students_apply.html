<h3>International students have additional requirements beyond the <em><a class="t4-tag-content-item " title="Home &raquo; Seattle University &raquo; Graduate Admissions &raquo; Apply &raquo; Applications" href="#" data-t4-type="sslink" data-t4-ss-link-id="10">general application</a></em>.</h3>

<h2>Transcripts</h2>
<p>An agency evaluation requiring academic records is necessary for all applicants who attended or completed their bachelor's and/or master's degree outside of the United States. The evaluation is not an English translation of the academic records, but a separate document completed by an evaluation service determining if the degree received outside the U.S. is equivalent to a U.S. degree and a GPA is calculated. Seattle University only accepts evaluations from the following agencies: 1) Educational Credential Evaluators (ECE)- We require the Course by Course Evaluation. More information on the transcript evaluation process and the evaluation application can be found at <a title="www.ece.org" href="http://www.ece.org/">www.ece.org</a> or 2) Educational Perspectives (EP)- We require the Detailed (Course by Course report). Directions and additional information specific to Seattle University can be found at <a title="www.edperspective.org/seattleu/" href="http://www.edperspective.org/seattleu/">www.edperspective.org/seattleu/</a>.</p>
<p>An official set of transcripts, degree certificates and/or graduation certificates also must be submitted to Seattle University. Documents are considered official only when they arrive in the original envelope from the issuing institution or sent electronically via secured institution&nbsp;to institution system.</p>
<h2>Applicants seeking an F-1 student visa</h2>
<p>Applicants seeking an F-1 student visa must also submit the <a class="t4-tag-content-item mceNonEditable" href="https://cms.seattleu.edu/terminalfour/SiteManager?ctfn=download&amp;fnno=60&amp;ceid=fe9954952863920064156468f2831c9a5ea18638" data-t4-instance-id="150" data-t4-media-id="317206" data-t4-markup-for="317206" data-t4-media-attributes="{&quot;attributes&quot;:{}}" data-t4-media-formatter="application/*" data-t4-media-language="en" data-t4-type="media">Declaration of Finances</a>&nbsp;form included in the application packet.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Applicants for whom English is a non-native language</h2>
<p>Applicants for whom English is a non-native language must demonstrate English proficiency regardless of English language studies, academic history, residence in the United States or an English-speaking country, or immigration status. English proficiency may be met with the <em>Test of English as a Foreign Language</em> (TOEFL), the <em>International English Language Testing System</em> (IELTS)&nbsp;or the Pearson Test of English (PTE).</p>
<p>Graduate and post baccalaureate applicants who received a baccalaureate degree or higher from Seattle University or a recognized college or university in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Ireland, New Zealand or Australia who remain in a country where English is the primary language for two years will not be required to submit English proficiency test scores.</p>
<p>Seattle University maintains the right to require English proficiency testing when deemed necessary.</p>
<p>The chart below outlines the English proficiency requirements for general admission as well as admission to the Culture and Language Bridge Program. The TOEFL exam has two different grading scales. The paper based TOEFL is still available with scores ranging from 310-677. For more information on what the TOEFL consists of and a list of official testing centers visit the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ets.org/">ETS web site</a>. Both score requirements are listed below.</p>

<p>* Some graduate programs are not able to accommodate CLB students in the curriculum as designed, so admitted students would need to complete CLB prior to starting their graduate studies.</p>
<p>Students with TOEFL scores in the CLB range will take a placement essay test upon arrival at Seattle University. Some students may have their CLB requirement waived based upon the results of the placement essay test.</p>
<p><strong>Successful completion of academic achievement in the University of Washington's Intensive English Program, Upper Division Level 5 with grades of 3.0 or higher also satisfies Seattle University's English-proficiency requirement.</strong></p>
<h2>Deadlines</h2>
<p>In order to allow for application processing, overseas mailings and visa processing, international applicants living overseas should submit an application six months prior to the quarter they wish to enroll or the program deadline, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p>Students who submit complete applications before the following dates will receive priority consideration:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fall Quarter (September):</strong> April 1</li>
<li><strong>Winter Quarter (January):</strong> September 1</li>
<li><strong>Spring Quarter (March):</strong> December 1 (F1 Visa applicants to the Software Engineering program should only apply for Fall or Winter admission)</li>
<li><strong>Summer Quarter (June):</strong> January 1</li>
</ul>
<h2>English Language and Culture Bridge Program</h2>
<p>The CLB program develops all phases of academic English and helps students overcome cultural barriers in the classroom. The graduate section is a 6-credit program and a 5-credit Business Communications class taken in the first quarter for students who have completed the equivalent of English 110 and based on a placement exam.
